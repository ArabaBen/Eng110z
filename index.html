		  <p style="text-align: center;">Why we want to bring matters of social media impacts to your attention. <br> </p>

		  <p>
			  Social media is a form of electronic communications. (Merriam-Webster definition)
			  Social media in this day and age has become a crucial part of our communication abilities. Throughout the years new forms of media have come out to be able to connect us with everyone whether it be close or far. Social media platforms such as Instagram, Snapchat, Tik tok, and so many other apps have made forms of communication easier and also fun. Not only does it bring us some sort of communication it can also affect our day to day lives negatively. (my definition)
		  </p>
		  <h4>Disadvantages of social media:</h4>
		  <p>
			  &#x2022; Decrease in face to face communication <br><br>
			  &#x2022; Lack of showing emotion in the sense that the emotions are not actually being expressed.<br><br>
			  &#x2022; It makes being lazy even easier than it already was. It is very easy to sit for hours and not do anything other than scroll for hours.<br><br>
			  &#x2022; One of the biggest disadvantages is the distraction it causes in life. Students struggle to get their work done hung up around the latest post or whoever they may be texting. Not only does it affect students but also in the workplace, it's pretty easy to pick up the phone and check the time until later realizing 5 minutes have passed going through the phone. <br><br>
			  &#x2022; Lastly, even if you think your information is safe and not ever at risk of leaking. Your credentials can be easily exposed if something were to happen like a malfunction or glitch with whatever social platform being used.
