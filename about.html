				<strong style="font-size: 36px;"><i>Hi,</i></strong> welcome to <b>Mediable</b>. This is a group project focused on the effect technology has on people and their daily lives. we, the authors are: Kevin Joy, Araba O., Zach Bach, Fresley.			
			</p>

			<p>
				We hope that this website serves as a valuable source for our readers. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Our project topic focuses on the talking points of Social media's negative and positive impact on mental health. <br><br></p>
			
				
			<h2 style="font-size: 30px;">Why share our topic?</h2>
				
			<p>This information is important because it will make people become aware of the negative effects that social media has on our mental health and might convince people to use it less. <br><br>
				
				We see our idea persuading our targeted audience because it will <b><i>bring awareness</i></b> of how social media is affecting us mentaly. 
				It is important for people to know about these effects because if people learn about them <b><i>and stop using excessive amounts</i></b> of social media it will have a positive impact on their mental health and their lives as a whole.

			</p>
			<P>Many articles we researched focused on arguments on how facebook and instagram in particular harms the mental health of the youth. Specifically how <b><i>“Instagram, in particular, had caused teen girls to feel worse about their bodies and led to increased rates of anxiety and depression.”</i></b> This matters because the audience that increasingly accesses these media are as young as 10 years old. An age far too young to be exposed to life changing fates. <i>(Daniels, Nicole. The New York Times)</i></P>
