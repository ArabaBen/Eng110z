				If we’re all being honest,  there isn't much nuance to add to the conversations surrounding social media and mental health. Everything that was needed to be said has been said for a decade and some change now. The solution to many may be simple to most- like “just stay off the internet”, “delete your instagram, facebook, tiktok, whatever” it is you're doing that's causing and impacting you emotionally and mentally. But as stated it isn't as simple. For a generation that's so anxious and has grown up in the information age, asking or telling us to stop engaging with tech and media is like asking us to forget and walk away from everything we've known and done since youth. 
				
				<br><br>
				In a sense,  it's an unrealistic ask. Also considering how many of our generation's use of media paved the way for influencing careers and other micro or macro digital marketing careers. So for most, the ask of quitting media cold turkey is asking them to forgo their livelihoods and means of financial gains / independence. 
			</p>
			<p>
				We understand the value of using tech &amp; media wisely because we do believe in the good of tech and media. Because with all the bad, there is good. <br><br>We have compiled a list to help you navigate ways to use tech and your media smarter and  safely.

							&#8226;have a purpose and set good goals for your social media. Having purpose doesn't always have to be so profound. It can be just as simple, mundane, and silly as you want. If your niche is food content,  your purpose can be as simple as “wanting to share food you love.” but also as silly as wanting to “make people hungry at night”. Therefore your goal should be to be active on your chosen platform for 10min to engage with followers/posts and to post your food continent in around a set time like 9pm.<br>
