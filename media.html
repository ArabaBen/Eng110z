						<h4>There's always a good </h4>

			
			<p>Social media also has positive aspects to it that can benefit everyone. For instance social media helps to keep people connected no matter where they are in the world and can be an outlet for creativity and positivity. This is depicted in an article by Zia Sherrell where it states that <strong style="font-size: 26px;"><i> “At its core, social media is a powerful communication tool that has changed how individuals interact with one another. It speeds up how people exchange and share information, thoughts, and ideas across virtual networks”</i></strong> (Sherrell). This is common knowledge to everyone because that is the whole point of social media’s design. It is meant to bring people together and allow people to share parts of their lives with each other without having to meet in person. This was especially useful during the pandemic when meeting in person was prohibited and one of the only ways to stay in contact with others was through the use of social media.</p>
			<p>	<strong style="font-size: 32px;">This</strong> quote also highlights another important feature of social media which is its speed. People can now get information from the other side of the world in a matter of seconds. This is incredibly fast compared to the time before the internet and electronics because it would have taken months to get that information. This allows for news to travel quickly and it means that no matter where you are you can communicate with someone as if they were sitting right next to you. </p>
			<p>	<strong style="font-size: 32px;">If </strong>social media only had negative effects on people it would not exist which means that the upsides must outway the downsides. Social media allows people to stay in touch and get information quickly which is useful in the world today where everything happens quickly. It can also be a creative outlet for people to express themselves and possibly make money off of these apps. Social media has numerous lucrative possibilities as well because businesses can advertise on it which can help grow their businesses. All of these important and useful aspects of social media is what makes them so popular and if used correctly and in moderation can actually have a positive effect on people.</p>
